# <a id="Introduction"></a> Introduction

Marketers use the [Optimove Relationship Marketing Hub](https://www.optimove.com/product) to automate the execution of highly-personalized customer communications. Optimove offers its clients an efficient way to report data from their websites and trigger campaigns accordingly.

This guide will show you how to setup the iOS (Swift) SDK in order to:

 - Track visitor and customer actions and events
 - Trigger Realtime campaigns


# <a id="Basic Setup"></a> Basic Setup

## **Request a Mobile SDK from Optimove**

Before implementing the Optimove Track & Trigger to track visitor / customer activities or perform other functions ([OptiPush](https://github.com/optimove-tech/A/blob/master/O/O.md)), you will need to contact your Optimove Customer Success Manager (CSM) or Optimove point of contact. <br>
To get started, please follow these instructions: 

### 1. Pre-requisites <br>

1. You have a paid development account for your iOS app, and valid certificates for remote notifications or APN Auth key.
2. The app's Deployment Target is at least iOS 10.0
3. Your Cocoapods version is 1.5 or above
4. You have a Firebase version of 5.4.0 (Optimove SDK is dependent on Firebase version 5.4.0)


### 2. Provide your iOS app details: <br>

Send the following information to your CSM or Optimove POC with your request for your Mobile SDK configuration details in order to incorporate into your iOS app :<br>

1.	***Auth key*** (with its key id) P8 format
2.	***Bundle ID*** (If you are using multiple apps for development/testing purposes, please provide a list of all bundle IDs being used for all environments.)
3.	***Team ID*** (from apple developer dashboard)
4.	***App Store ID*** (from itunesconnect)<br>
  

### 3. Retrieve *OptimoveTenantInfo* details: <br>


After providing the info above, you will receive a *OptimoveTenantInfo* from the Optimove Product Integration Team that contains:<br>
1.	***End-point URL*** – The URL where the tenant configurations reside
2.	***Unique Optimove token*** – The actual token, unique per tenant
3.	***Configuration name*** – The version of the desired configuration

For a demo application containing the iOS SDK, please use our [iOS GitHub repository](https://github.com/optimove-tech/iOS-SDK-Integration-Guide/tree/master/DemoApplication/SwiftDemoApp).

    

## Setting up the iOS SDK

### 1. Install the SDK 
In your Application Target Capabilities: 
1. Enable `push notifications` capabilities <br>
2. Enable`remote notifications` capabilities in`Background Modes`

### 2.  Download *OptimoveSDK* pod
In order to work with the Optimove SDK for your iOS native app, need to download its module from CocoaPods.

1. In your Podfile, add the following:

`pod OptimoveSDK`


Example:
```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'

target 'iOSDemo' do
  use_frameworks!

  pod 'OptimoveSDK'
end
```

2. `OptimoveSDK` relies on other modules as infrastructure, such as `Firebase`, so when you download `OptimoveSDK` you get the following frameworks:

* `Firebase/Core` version `5.4.0`
* `Firebase/Messaging`
* `Firebase/DynamicLinks`

### 3. If you are using Optipush, see additional configurations [here](https://github.com/optimove-tech/A/tree/master/O/O%20for%20iOS/O%20for%20iOS%20V1.2#2-optipush-configuration)  
    
### 4. Run the SDK

In your `AppDelegate` class, inside the callback
  `application (_: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)` method, create a new `OptimoveTenantInfo` object. This object should contain:

1. The end-point URL
2. Unique Optimove token
3. The configuration version provided by the Optimove Integration Team
4. Indication for existing Firebase module inside your application
5. Indication for using your own `Firebase/Messaging`

Use this object as an argument for the SDK function,

 ```swift
  Optimove.sharedInstance.configure(info:)
```  
This call initializes the OptimoveSDK singleton.

6. You should register for notification certificate from APNs using `UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()`

>Note: It is necessary to `import OptimoveSDK` in any file that uses `OptimoveSDK` API 

<br>

For example:
```swift
import UIKit
import UserNotifications
import OptimoveSDK

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder,
UIApplicationDelegate,
UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate
{
var window: UIWindow?

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
	// Intialize the Optimove SDK
	let info = OptimoveTenantInfo(url: "https://optimove.mobile.demo",
		  token: "abcdefg12345678",
		  version: "myapp.ios.1.0.0",
		  hasFirebase: false,
		  useFirebaseMessaging: false)
	Optimove.sharedInstance.configure(for: info)
	
	// Notify the OS that the app needs to receive an APNs token
	UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
	
	return true
	}
}
```
>Note : The initialization **must** be called as soon as possible, unless you have your own _Firebase SDK_. In this case, call `Optimove.configure(info:)` right after calling `FirebaseApp.configure()`.

  

Still in `AppDelegate`, please implement the following callbacks:

```swift
// Called when the OS generates an APNs token
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data)
{
	// Forward the callback to the Optimove SDK
	Optimove.sharedInstance.application(didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken: deviceToken)
}

// Called when a push message is received by the OS and forwarded to the app's process (used for Optimove analytical purposes)
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
		didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any],
		fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void)
{
	// Forward the callback to the Optimove SDK 
	if !Optimove.sharedInstance.didReceiveRemoteNotification(userInfo: userInfo,didComplete: completionHandler)
	{
		// The push message was not targeted for Optimove SDK. Implement your logic here or leave as is. 
		completionHandler(.noData)
	}
}
```
  

### 3. Important Installation and Usage Notes

The SDK initialization process occurs asynchronously, off the `Main Thread`.


Before calling the Public API methods, make sure that the SDK has finished initialization by calling the `registerSuccessStateListener(listener:)` method with an instance of `OptimoveSuccessStateListener`.


When the SDK has finished its initialization process, the callback `optimove(_:didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions:)` is executed with any missing permissions that the SDK would require to operate optimally. 

### 4. Tracking Visitor and Customer activity
 
You will also need to include the following steps to complete the basic setup:

 - Tracking User Activities and Events
 - [Stitching App Visitors to Registered Customer IDs](https://github.com/optimove-tech/A/blob/master/i/V1.2/swift/README.md#stitching-app-visitors-to-registered-customer-ids)
<br>


# <a id="Advanced Setup"></a>Advanced Setup
Use the Advanced Setup (optional) in order to track visitor and customer customized actions and events.
As described in [Tracking Custom Events](https://github.com/optimove-tech/SDK-Custom-Events-for-Your-Vertical), this step requires collaboration between you and Optimove’s Product Integration Team. Please contact your Optimove Customer Success Manager (CSM) or Optimove point of contact to schedule a meeting with the Product Integration team.

>**Note**: You can deploy the basic setup, followed by adding the advanced setup at a later stage. The Basic Setup is a pre-requisite.

<br>
  
# <a id="Track"></a>Track

## <a id="Stitching Visitors to Users"></a>Stitching App Visitors to Registered Customer IDs

Once the user has downloaded the application and the _Optimove SDK_ run for the first time, the user is considered a _Visitor_, i.e. unidentified user<br>

Once the user has authenticated and become identified by a known `PublicCustomerId`, then the user is considered a _Customer_.<br>

As soon as this happens for each individual user, call the following method with the newly acquired  `CustomerId`:<br>
```swift
Optimove.sharedInstance.set(userId:)
```

>**Notes:** 
>- The `CustomerId` is usually provided by the server application that manages customers, and is the **same** ID provided to Optimove during the daily customer data transfer. 
 >- You may call the `set(userId:)` method at any time, regardless if the initialization success callback was received
> - If you will be sending encrypted userId, please follow the steps in [Reporting encrypted CustomerIDs](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Reporting-Encrypted-CustomerID)
 
<br>

## <a id="Tracking a Screen Visit"></a>Tracking Screen Visits

To track which screens the user has visited in your app, call the following method:<br>

```swift
Optimove.sharedInstance.reportScreenVisit(viewControllersIdentifiers:url:category)
```

The `viewControllersIdentifiers` argument should include an array that represents the path of `ViewControllers` to the current screen.<br>
To support more complex view hierarchies, you may also specify a screen URL in the second parameter and give the page a category.<br>

For example:
```swift
 override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool)
    {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)
        Optimove.sharedInstance.reportScreenVisit(viewControllersIdentifiers: ["main","cart"],
	        url: URL(string:"http://my.bundle.id/main/cart/pre_checkout")!, // Optional
	        category: "Shoes") // Optional
    }
```
>Note: The `reportScreenVisit` method should only be called after the initialization success callback was received.

<br>

## Tracking Custom Events  

Optimove clients may use the Optimove Mobile SDK to track specific customer actions and other custom events to Optimove (beyond OOTB events such visits). This data is used for tracking visitor and customer behavior, targeting campaigns to specific visitor and/or customer segments and triggering campaigns based on particular visitor and/or customer actions/events.  
  
To see examples of Custom Events, please visit [Defining the Set of Custom Tracking Events](https://github.com/optimove-tech/SDK-Custom-Events-for-Your-Vertical) that you will report for more information.

>**Note**: While you can always add/change the custom events and parameters at a later date (by speaking with the Optimove Product Integration Team), only the particular custom events that you and the Optimove Product Integration Team have already defined together will be supported by your Optimove site.

### How to Track a Custom Event from within your iOS app

Once you and the Optimove Product Integration Team have together defined the custom events supported by your app, the Product Integration Team will implement your particular functions within your Optimove site, while you will be responsible for implementing the `OptimoveEvent` protocol of the individual events within your app using the appropriate function calls.<br>

The protocol defines 2 properties:
1.	`name: String` – Declares the custom event’s name
2.	`parameters: [String:Any]` – Defines the custom event's parameters.

Custom Event example:
```swift
class MyCustomEvent: OptimoveEvent
{
    var name: String
    var parameters: [String:Any]
    
    init(name: String, parameters: [String:Any])
    {
        self.name = name
        self.parameters = parameters
    }
}
```

Then send that event through the `reportEvent(event:)` method of the `Optimove` singleton.
  
```swift
override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
	super.viewDidAppear(animated)
	Optimove.sharedInstance.reportEvent(event: MyCustomEvent())
}
```
<br>

>**Notes**:
>- The `reportEvent(event:)` method should only be called after the initialization success callback was received.
>- As already mentioned, all [custom events](https://github.com/optimove-tech/SDK-Custom-Events-for-Your-Vertical) must be pre-defined in your Tenant configurations by the Optimove Product Integration Team.
>- Reporting of custom events is only supported if you have the basic Mobile SDK setup implemented.
>- Events use **snake_case** as a naming convention. Separate each word with one underscore character (_) and no spaces. (e.g., Checkout_Completed)
